Install polybar as a replacement for i3 status bar

Clone a package from Github:
git clone https://github.com/jaagr/polybar.git (stable version)
git clone https://github.com/jaagr/polybar-git.git (development version)

Install a package (-i) and missing dependencies (-s) and remove them at the end (-r):
cd polybar
makepkg -sri

Removing a package with pacman is the same as with regular packages:
sudo pacman -R polybar

In case of polybar, make sure you also install a jsoncpp dependency:
sudo pacman -S jsoncpp

Sometimes there are still problems with missing dependencies for libjsoncpp.so. Error reported is "polybar: error while 
loading shared libraries: libjsoncpp.so.19: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory". That's because it's 
lib files change names on each new update. If that happens it is generally recommended to recompile polybar after each jsoncpp update. In case there are 
still problems you can also add symlink to the correct version:
ln -s /usr/lib/libjsoncpp.so.20 /usr/lib/libjsoncpp.so.19

Install example polybar configuration:
install -Dm644 /usr/share/doc/polybar/config ~/.config/polybar/config

And run it with:
