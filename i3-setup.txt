Start i3 tilling window manager at boot...

You can start X manually by simply:
startx

Our you can do it at startup by assing following lines to ~/.bashrc:
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && [[ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]]; then
startx
fi

To start i3 as soon as X starts add following line to ~/.xinitrc:
echo "exec i3" >> ~/.xinitrc

If you want to install Gnome as a desktop environment, which comes fully equiped with 
tons of applications (maybe even too much for my taste) you should run:
sudo pacman -S [gnome|lxdm]
sudo systemctl start [gdm|lxdm].service
sudo systemctl enable [gdm|lxdm].service

There are also options "stop" and "disable" for services.


Install Xorg server, i3 window manager, LightDM display manager, and two terminals 
(rxvt will be used as default, xterm is a fallback option):
sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit xorg-xclock xorg-twm xterm rxvt-unicode
sudo pacman -S i3 dmenu
sudo pacman -S lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter

Some other xorg packages might be needed:
sudo pacman -S xorg-server-xephyr xorg-backlight ttf-dejavu

Make sure i3 is started when X starts:
sudo 'exec i3' > ~/.xinitrc

Start LightDM service (if you want autostart put 'enable' instead of 'start'):
systemctl start lightdm.service

On the first start i3 should prompt you for the setup. If not, just run:
i3-config-wizard

It creates i3 config file in ~/.config/i3/config. Before you rerun the i3-config-wizard make sure to delete the old config.

Setup gaps between windows in i3-gaps (probably installed by default instead of 
i3-wm) by adding following lines in ~/.config/i3/config (measurement is in px):
gaps inner 5
gaps outer 5

To apply changes to i3 config, restart i3 with $mod-Shift-r.

Setup desktop background:
sudo pacman -S feh
feh --bg-fill geeky_wallpaper.png

For startup, put it into ~/.xinitrc:
echo 'feh --bg-fill geeky_wallpaper.png' >> ~/.xinitrc

If you have no background image, you can fetch them with wget:
sudo pacman -S wget
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8rr7mjb4ifa8u4/geeky_wallpaper.png?dl=0

Set transparent terminal windows with Compton:
sudo pacman -S compton

Run compton as a daemon, without shadow effects (for autostart, put it into ~/.xinitrc):
compton -CGb

Add following configuration for rxvt in your ~/.Xdefaults file to manage transparency:
urxvt*depth: 32
urxvt*background: rgba:0000/0000/0200/c800

Also, add these lines to ~/.Xdefaults to make rxvt dark and pretty:
URxvt*scrollBar: false
URxvt*background: Black
URxvt*foreground: White
URxvt*colorUL: yellow
URxvt*underlineColor: yellow
URxvt.font: xft:monospace:size=8

Restart your xrdb:
xrdb .Xresources

If you don't need a display manager (LightDM) and want to start X manually you can 
simply configure ~/.xinitrc with something like:

setxkbmap hr
feh --bg-fill ~/geeky_wallpaper.png
compton -CGb
xrdb ~/.Xresources
exec i3

And then, after logging to tty with your credentials, start X manually with:
startx

If you later want to kill X server and return to tty simply use Ctrl-Alt-Backspace 
shortcut. 

Setup conky:
sudo pacman -S conky
conky -bd

Setup a color theme matching your chosen background with pywal and 50% 
terminal transparency:
sudo pacman python-pywal python-setuptools
wal -i [PATH-TO-WALLPAPER] -a 50

To make a theme persistent on boot add following line to ~/.xinitrc:
wal -R
