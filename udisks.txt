How to manage disks with modern udisks2 utility (instead of mount)

Install udisks2 package:
sudo pacman -S udisks2

View help and available disks on the system:
udisksctl help
udisksctl dump

Mount a desired disk (in this case, just a specific partition within a disk!):
udisksctl mount -b /dev/sda2

Disk is now mounted in /run/media/matija/ and user can access it normally.

To unmount it:
udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sda2
